I am currently pursuing a PhD in Governance at the Hertie School in Berlin. My research focuses on citizen deliberation in online enviornments. This is only one way of addressing the important question of how the digital sphere influences democracy. In other words, I am interested in how the internet's potential can be used to foster a democratic discourse among a diverse citizenship to develop a livable, sustainable and just future. 

I graduated from the University of Oxford, UK, with a MSc degree in Social Data Science, and from the University of Kassel, Germany, with a BSc and MSc degree in Psychology. I previously worked as a student research assistant at the Center for Environmental Systems Research (CESR) Kassel, responsible for the statistical analysis of data in a DFG funded project on the public perception of climate engineering technologies. I am further interested in the public perception of climate change, political opinion formation, online communication dynamics and the emergence of collective behaviour. I would like to help construct better policies for sustainability and human well-being, such as the sustainable transformation of mobility systems in urban areas, using my expertise in quantitative methods and psychology.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Governance at the Hertie School in Berlin. My research focus are the social and ecological aspects of digitization processes in urban areas. I graduated from the University of Oxford, UK, with a MSc degree in Social Data Science, and from the University of Kassel, Germany, with a BSc and MSc degree in Psychology. I previously worked as a student research assistant at the Center for Environmental Systems Research (CESR) Kassel, responsible for the statistical analysis of data in a DFG funded project on the public perception of climate engineering technologies. I am interested in the public perception of climate change, political opinion formation, online communication dynamics and the emergence of collective behaviour. I would like to help construct better policies for sustainability and human well-being, such as the sustainable transformation of mobility systems in urban areas, using my expertise in quantitative methods and psychology.

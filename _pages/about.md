# About

I am a doctoral researcher at the Hertie School in Berlin. My research focuses on deliberation in online enviornments and the question of how the digital sphere influences democracy. While the attention economy, algorithmic curation and social network dynamics of online platforms can be a threat to democracy, I am interested in how the internet's potential can be used to ameliorate democratic discourse among a diverse citizenship to develop a livable, sustainable and just future. 

I graduated from the University of Oxford, UK, with a MSc degree in Social Data Science, and from the University of Kassel, Germany, with a BSc and MSc degree in Psychology. I am currently working as a teaching assistant for the MSc course "Statistical Modeling & Causal Inference" of the policy analysis track at the Hertie School. I previously worked as a research consultant at the Hertie School's Data Science Lab and at the Center for Environmental Systems Research (CESR) in Kassel.

I am futher interested in the public perception of climate change, the psychology of sustainable behavior (especially travel and transportation) and the effects of science communication. Online opinion dynamics, including political polarization, conspiracy myths, extremism and processes of online radicalization are another area of research that fascinates me. The interplay of humans and technology, for example risk perception and technology acceptance in the face of crises (e.g. climate engineering and contact tracing) are another interesting field in which I have some expertise. I also like to consider critical perspectives on technological solutions, for example in the context of smart cities and AI.

*I'm a computational social scientist with three anchors: psychology, politics and the internet.*

# About

I am a doctoral researcher at the Hertie School in Berlin. My research focuses on deliberation in online enviornments and the question of how the digital sphere influences democracy. While the attention economy, algorithmic curation and social network dynamics of online platforms can be a threat to democracy, I am interested in how the internet's potential can be used to ameliorate democratic discourse among a diverse citizenship to develop a livable, sustainable and just future. 

I graduated from the University of Oxford, UK, with a MSc degree in Social Data Science, and from the University of Kassel, Germany, with a BSc and MSc degree in Psychology. I am currently working as a research consultant at the Hertie School's Data Science Lab. I previously worked at the Center for Environmental Systems Research (CESR) in Kassel, responsible for the statistical analysis of a project on the public perception of climate engineering technologies. I am further interested in the public perception of climate change, political opinion formation, online communication dynamics and the emergence of collective behaviour. I would like to help construct better policies for sustainability and human well-being, such as the sustainable transformation of mobility systems in urban areas, using my expertise in quantitative methods and psychology.

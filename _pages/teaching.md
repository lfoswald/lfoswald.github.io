### ðŸŽ’ Statistical Modeling & Causal Inference

* Spring 2021
* Teaching language: English
* Program: Policy Analysis Track of the Master in Public Policy at the Hertie School, Berlin
* Teaching Assistant to Prof. Simon Munzert

I reviewed the lecture materials and hold R tutorials on the practical implementation of causal inference techniques for two diverse, interdisciplinary and international groups of students on a weekly basis. In collaboration with Sebastian Ramirez-Ruiz, we constructed weekly assignments to assess their learning progress continuously.

**Topics covered:** Causality, DAGs, the Potential Outcomes Framework, Regression, Matching, Instrumental Variables, Regression Discontinuity Designs, Difference in Difference, Panel Data and Fixed Effects, Moderation and Mediation.
